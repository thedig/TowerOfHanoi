== Towers of Hanoi

This is a rails application composed primarily of a JavaScript game.  The rails 
framework is leveraged to manage styling and bootstrap specifically. All of the 
rendering occurs in a single page for the game itself.  The game itself is 
written purely in JavaScript and is object oriented, separating out the core 
game functionality from the UI features.
